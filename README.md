# barchart-project
This was a project expecting to generate a bar chart for data display onto any html:

The project was built for direct user input.
First line of inputs control how the data will be displayed on the chart:
  - Head, X & Y axis titles can change from text, size and color.
  - Display how the chart will scale on the left
  - Space between bars of data
  - Control where the quantity of will be displayed
Second line of inputs control the data being implementated into the chart:
  - Labeling the data
  - Color of the data title
  - Quantity of the data. Which also generates a bar representing the data, relative to the scale. 
  - Color of the bar being generated
Additional Lines can be accessed through 'Additional Value' button for multi value data input.
Upon subbmission, all inputs are cleared.
The reset button clears all data from the chart.
Also included a hide button beneath the chart, for the UI to be hidden when not needed.
Only library used was jQuery.
Only known issue is the the first submission click does not seem to trigger the input clear function as desired. But does seem to work after the second attempt.
I do wish to implement more animations for bar generation and and better color selector option.
I do not have a detailed list of resources as I used an absurd amount to learn from for this. But the sites i used were:
  - Google
  - Youtube
  - w3schools.com
  - stackoverflow.com
